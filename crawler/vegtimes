Believe in God,Trust on God.He is the Creator of Universe. He loves his children. #GodisGreat, I love God Shiva.He helps me on every step.
Money can't buy love and Happiness,One should do Meditation.Doing #meditation  will give you #Happiness, #Love and #Peace.
Plants and trees have lots of positive vibrations,so try to be near them during free Time,your positive energy will grow.
RT @mortakaiben: #Happiness comes from #Pure #Clarity
Negative thoughts are like blockage,they Stops person from Spiritual growth. So Think only Good thoughts,Be Positive. #Spirituality
Be Positve,Be Good,Love Everyone,Love own Self,and free the mind from lust,anger,fear,then only a Person can grow spiritually.#Spirituality
Energy is not different it is one,in pure form,it's just the vibrations that makes that Energy functions differently. #Spirituality
No Matter how much bad is happening in life,But Always smile,and love your life.Praise God,and Ask God for help,He will help you.#Godisgood
When body is full of #Love,it starts radiating Energy,and that Energy starts Growing in form of light. #Spirituality #Meditation

To be Happy should be the Real purpose of life. #happiness
Have Faith in God.
There is no Secret of Happiness,Happiness comes when Positive Vibrations increase to that Level,when the heart is filled with pure Love.
It's not a Science that can be Learn,nor any one can teach Spiritual Science,it is only Gain through Experience by own Self.
Love Everyone,Love Gives a Person high amount of #Positive #Energy.Confidence will increase there is no doubt.#love
This world is illusion not Real,it's like a Dream,Only those who walks on the way of truth can wake up from this dream.So Think Positively.
Only Positive Energy is useful for Human beings in Spiritual and Physical Growth,Negative Energy always Destroy."Always be Good &amp; Do Good".
Old age can be Stopped,By Increasing Positive Energy and after that Projecting that energy on skin,blood,bone,anywhere.
All Super Powers and Abilities are Gained when a person grows Spiritually.A state of One,where he find himself one with the World.
A person who do real meditation never feels bored,True Meditation increase Energy,that makes a person feel better.
Filling Heart with #Awareness,then #Love will be Experience.
Positive thinking is the most Important.Only Good vibes can makes a person Healthy. #positivethinking #spiritual
This World is to Experience #Happiness,and Enjoying it,Not to Stop doing anything and just Sitting and doing nothing.
A person is weaker when his Awareness is low,when All his Awareness flows down.If Awareness flows upwards,then He will be Healthy.
There is no Difficult thing,it's our mind that makes that thing Difficult.
Happiness can be Gained when Mind Stop Worrying About All Problems of life.
Reality exist only because mind exist.
Life means to move, not to stop at one point.
Knowing Self is the Ultimate True Knowledge. #spiritual #quote
Where there is love there will be Always Positivity #positivity #quote

Hi @EmmytheCat my neighbour has 13 chicks in their garden - what are we supposed to do with chicks?
We get spoiled for a while then they put us on the treadmill !  I have become a bit lazy though and now II'll go for a nap keep in touch xx
Miaow I get a can of tuna as a Friday night treat then a couple of shrimps if they are eating them too but then its back to Royal Canine!
My vet said that I should have Royal Canine biscuits with my wet food. Does your vet recommend brands?
Dear @EmmytheCat I agree.  When she puts out the cheese for the blackbirds, I take the oportunity to indulge and I let them eat my biscuits!

Have other cats noticed the same thing?
So its good to talk about them
Humans are always doing things
We learn by observing
it has become a bit of a routine
Sat looking through the patio doors on cat patrol
A whole 5 hours later I jump up on the desk and mop is looking at my twitter site and they have only loaded up a photo of me asleep.
...and starting clicking away saying 'give it your best twitter shot'.  I felt a headache coming on and made my apologies and went to bed..
... She goes on about paying for my whiskers cat food and ratting will save getting the pest control out. Then Cocoa pop got his camera out
Cocoa!!! where is Cocoa!!! She points at me and says Cocoa you have got some work to do. Credit crunch means we all have to pull our weight
So anyway, Cocoa mop came home yesterday and was talking to the human next door who said a rat has been spotted so she comes home and says..
Why does this twitter only have so many characters.  When I get a bit of twitter time I like to compose a proper ol' cats choir.
I call him cocoa pop as it is quite cute and they are always acting cute around me.  Must be something about humans who look after us!
Miaow again... Cocoa pop insisted on having my own photo on my twitter but I was happy for the stripy cat photo which gave me some anonymity

@JezOelschlagel We were talking about respect. Ur changing the topic now that respect no longer applies to those u eat. Understood. #farm365
@JezOelschlagel Furthermore, plants intended for fruit to be eaten for seed dispersal. Most veg are annual (die yearly) as well.
@JezOelschlagel  Fruits and vegetables are not sentient. They have no cognisant desires to respect...
@JezOelschlagel according 2 this literal definition of "respect", u have none for the animals u cut up &amp; eat #farm365 http://t.co/0okVViOVCS

@JezOelschlagel Because I wanted to know about YOUR feelings and thoughts. Not the oxford dictionary. I wanted to understand how YOU think.
@JezOelschlagel U googled respect. U have no idea what it means to YOU. Again, no consideration. Thoughtless #farm365 http://t.co/6M7g2GJqd2
@JezOelschlagel You respect animals, cut them into little pieces &amp; eat them. You respect your family. What does respect mean to u? #farm365
@JezOelschlagel You are not responding to anything I say or any questions... No insight whatsoever. No consideration. This isn't conversing.

@knowhowtohelp it's not up to me to keep your customer records accurate and in check! #curryspcworld #incompetent
@knowhowtohelp you should have all of this on record. It's been to two different stores in this timeframe - Portsmouth and Bournemouth
@knowhowtohelp just typical that you can "only find 1 repair". It's just not good enough - you've had it twice more since the repair in June
@knowhowtohelp now you've got me trapped; I can't stop paying for this policy - once I do I'll be left with a broken laptop! #curryspcworld
@knowhowtohelp now I have to waste more time an money taking the laptop in for repair YET AGAIN! #whateverhappens more like #neverhappens
@knowhowtohelp all I want is a laptop I can rely on for uni final year...not 1 I have to keep bringing back that can lose all my work
@knowhowtohelp ref BFJ4VN9M was given the laptop back last week to find still not working properly! Same fault as before! #curryspcworld

@knowhowtohelp @curryspcworld you've been on watchdog last year about it and still haven't changed a bit. Telling the same lies instore
@knowhowtohelp had my laptop returned 4 times and due a write off and never happened! My laptop broke 5th time. Lost all my work #raging

@JoeCienkowski These are the dumbest things I've ever heard! I've got a one word question for you - Dinosaurs?!!!!
I can resist anything except temptation...
@JoeCienkowski So let me get this right you believe that a dude actually walked on water and turned water in to wine right?
@JoeCienkowski ...and therefore doesnt give credit to anything in the bible, the basis of Christianity.
@JoeCienkowski ...There are plenty of other beliefs that dont recognise 'The' Jesus...
@JoeCienkowski So we have a man at that time, that may have been called jesus. Great...
@JoeCienkowski So what makes your belief any different to theirs?
@JoeCienkowski I don't. But thanks for the offer. Im just saying that just because people believe in something, doesnt make it real
@JoeCienkowski that doesnt mean anything im afraid, Santa also dates back as early as the 4th century
@JoeCienkowski Yeah it's absolute madness! How many kids around the world believe in Santa Claus? That doesnt make him real...
@JoeCienkowski Your not making any sense mate. Come again?
@JoeCienkowski Jesus didn't live!
RT @vtpatriot: @JoeCienkowski @suave_sam evidence for a world-wide flood's a big lie, Joe. Then again, so are religions.
@JoeCienkowski thats anywhere from 5 - 50 million species on 1 boat. Sound realistic to you?
@JoeCienkowski hmmm lets see, this guy builds a huge boat, and puts 2 of every species on the planet in it. Do you realise how this sounds?
@JoeCienkowski not foolish, just science. Foolishness is taking the bible literally...
@JoeCienkowski says who? Of course it can, life came about by chance. A fluke, pure luck.
@JoeCienkowski are you fucking retarded? The bible is a fucking story... Get over it.

#ARealMan is the one who helps you grow. Who understands you without speaking a word. Who supports you. Who accepts your imperfections.

Pensa a chi ti pensa perchè se pensi a chi non ti pensa pensa che tu non lo pensi, quindi pensaci!
'L'hai fatto una volta'

Sbattere il mignolino del piede addosso ad un mobile
Fai partire la musica in riproduzione casuale,per poi saltare ogni canzone fino a quando trovi quella che volevi ascoltare sin dall’inizio
'L'hai fatto una volta'

Imposti l’orario della sveglia prima di quanto sia necessario,in modo da poterla ritardare almeno due o tre volte
'L'hai fatto una volta'

Quando fai una lunga telefonata, inizi a camminare per tutta la casa.
'L'hai fatto una volta'

Mentre fai la doccia, fai una coppa con le mani, raccogli più acqua possibile e la fai cadere per terra.

Voy dejando escrito retazos de pasado, porque a mi memoria se la lleva el viento.
En esta inmensidad, a la que llaman tiempo. http://t.co/L3yJOHqt
Ni la vida, ni la inmensidad se capturan en una fotografía. http://t.co/4iauL0Be
Un minuto de silencio por Don Cangrejo :p
La vida es tan corta que tenemos necesidad de cuantificarla.
No seas como el agua clara que se enturbia con el viento; sé como el agua turbia que se aclara cuando fluye.
Píntame un mundo de colores y una noche plagada de sueños.
@fenrismx es un hecho
Cada vez somos menos los que nos quedamos, los que aún creemos que en ésta árida tierra cosecharemos. Suerte a los que se fugan.
@fenrismx te mando un abrazo, mucho éxito en aquellas tierras!
Tantos siglos, tanto mundo, tanto espacio... Y coincidir.
Un día vi el sol ponerse cuarenta y tres veces! AdSE
Por cada persona que triunfa, hay mil personas sufriendo una derrota.
Por qué seguimos siendo indiferentes a la realidad que no es nuestra, pero que nos impide llegar a la utópica fantasia de tod@s.
Ojala nunca deje de maravillarme, de cuestionarte, de creer que nada esta escrito; si algún día lo hago, no dudes en recordármelo.
Hace tiempo que dejamos de ser parte del mundo, para intentar hacerlo nuestro; otro gran error de la humanidad des-mund-anizada
La muerte comienza cuando se deja de disfrutar la vida; cuando el placer se convierte en martirio y la costumbre se te escapa por los poros.

@OPAPP_peace if the President CANNOT discipline offices under his office, how can we have discipline throughout the country, much less BBL?
@OPAPP_peace yes, tv program with PDEA (an office under the Office of the President) in its backdrop openly attacking President PNOY &amp; BBL.

@gmanews kung totoo ang sinasabi ni Ongpin, Oreta at Avisado, AKO PO AY NANAWAGAN NA WAG NA TAYONG MAGBIGAY SA BOY SCOUTS.
@PhilippineStar D'yos ko, pls wag naman. Kawawa naman ang masang Pilipino, pinaiikot lang kami ng mga kapitalistang cronies!
@PhilippineStar Hoping that when BINAY becomes president sila na naman ang sentro? Are we not looking at THE COMING CRONIES OF PRES. BINAY?
@PhilippineStar The Ongpins and Oretas/Cojuancos (Peping) hindi sentro ngayon ng power kaya critical sila kay PNoy, pero BINAY sila?
@PhilippineStar Ngayon lang kayo hindi naka-"pasok". So, you want a Binay presidency for your maligayang araw na naman?
@PhilippineStar Mr. Ongpin, may I ask, hindi n'yo ba pinaiikot lang ang masang Pilipino? Marcos time you were there? Cory you were there?
@9newsph @TrillanesSonny are we not looking now at THE COMING CRONIES OF THE BINAY PRESIDENCY? God forbid!
@9newsph so, for avisado to say this is personal between mercado &amp; binay, who is he fooling? are we not looking at the coming cronies?
@9newsph didn't they (ongpins, oretas, peping, tingting) support NOYBI (Noynoy-BINAY) in the last presidential elections?
@9newsph what's the relationship of the ongpins to the oretas? remember the "kamag-anak incorporated" during cory's time led by peping?
@9newsph who are the ongpins? what was their relationship with marcos? why one of them even committed suicide because of business problems?

One of the things you notice after watching  Fried Green Tomatoes enough is that in critical scenes, clocks are almost always ticking.
@RonnieSnark @ky_tsunami the book even comes with recipes!!!
@ky_tsunami @RonnieSnark yes, you should. It's a fantastic read
.@RonnieSnark @ky_tsunami  Fried Green Tomatoes does the book close justice. Books, tho, will always push the social envelope further.
.@RonnieSnark @ky_tsunami the book read like a Michner novel: It tells the story of generations of folks in a small Southern town
@RonnieSnark the book is as much about the town as the people, and the Black families have a much more major role in the town in the book
@RonnieSnark you know, it sounds cliche, but I'd very much recommend the book first. The film glosses over the Black folks contributions 1/2
@ky_tsunami the movie isn't so clear about it, but the book makes it crystal clear.
Fried Green Tomatoes also reminds me of my  grandma, @ky_tsunami. She was born in the 20s and is a great storyteller.
@ky_tsunami heck yeah!

If anyone can be kind to donate please do so. :) These kids are suffering everyday from hunger. :(
and $65 can provide a grab-n-go breakfast cart to an elementary school so that every student starts every school day with a healthy meal.
$35 can help a child care center provide free afterschool snacks and suppers to at-risk children all year long.
$9 can help connect a child with healthy lunches during summer when school is out.
$4 can help provide a child facing hunger with a backpack full of healthy food over a weekend when school meals are not available.
$1 can help provide a hungry child with 10 healthy meals.
If anyone can please help our team out we are trying to raise $300 for the children.

Barber said, Something for the weekend Sir?  I was surprised that he didn't mean Spleen.
British Spleen Morris, if we follow your team please follow back.
@buzz2003 @TripeUK Yeah, but I am so overcome just thinking about how advanced the TMB is in comparison to BS
@SeloneM @TripeUK If anyone has been negatively affected by this don't worry the last is now receiving treatment
@TripeUK
@cwells25br @Indiegogo Sure but do you mean a proposal or a donation
@cwells25br @Indiegogo Good afternoon Sir!

@boblucasjr @TripeUK Yes we know that problem which is why our technical adviser suggests a sugar coating
@standardnews @MPSStamfordHill Really?  It may be time to move to Stamford Hilly
@TripeUK Really what is the authority for that, is it primary legislation?
@JamesPSVine Indeed.
@sellmylivestock @TripeUK Its very tempting but where would we keep it?

We may vote for the Morris Party.
@TripeUK Is that your latest B Movie?
@buzz2003 @Geo_Dayle @TripeUK Pay attention will you!
We will be actively looking for Morris Dancers this year and donating to their cause.
@buzz2003 @Geo_Dayle @TripeUK Can you tweet that on home as only you and I can see it.
Some say there are no real men left but we think that all the real men are Morris Men.
@TripeUK I can't see him is it Nigel from The Tankerton Arms, he eats Spleen as well!
@ladymuckstuff Thats why we stopped going to the cathedral city!
British Spleen has always felt an affinity with Morris Dancing we are both faintly ridiculous
@ladymuckstuff It starts with that but soon it will be Old Winchester
@TripeUK Would you employ a Barrister?   If so how many hundred need apply?
@ladymuckstuff That'll be a wake up call for the Cheese Box in Harbour Street.
@TripeUK All that to make a flannel
@TripeUK Mush be Shum Mishtake!
@TheCommonCowJoe No No No!

@buzz2003 We advise vegans etc to seek refuge at @TripeUK
@cwells25br Very productive 'con' this morning we look forward to working with you in an Offal way!
@meat_people @TripeUK Dear Sir Norman is this acceptable?
@buzz2003 no thanks and definitely not vegemite!
@standardnews @ChaimHochhauser Has the case FINished?
@buzz2003 Even better with a Tripe seam running through it!
@tasteofgame @cookerycourses The @TripeUK have their own
@tasteofgame @cookerycourses See our website: http://t.co/g7TxkJsV7k
@cookerycourses @tasteofgame So apart from Spleen and Tripe what are the other 23 on?

@DustySubstances @TripeUK @DropTheTap @BeefFacts No indeed you don't, bit like Tripe.
The result of a survey of Spleen consumption came back as Nuneaton
We are aiming at Morris Sides as we think they might like Spleen as much as they like Tripe.
Today's challenge is to find 36 more followers to get us up to a nice round 400
@DustySubstances @TripeUK @DropTheTap @BeefFacts Start as you intend to go on Madam with us we live every day like it is our last.
@DropTheTap @BeefFacts @TripeUK Our boffins tried to make a trapezoid with it but the edges are impossible to define.
@DropTheTap @BeefFacts @TripeUK Actually not very well we find that it sort of slithers off itself.
@TripeUK @DropTheTap @BeefFacts The key to a good diet is not 'will' power but 'won't' power. The Spleen Diet destroys appetite effectively.
@TripeUK An over reaction if you ask us but good ol' SnNorm honourable as ever
Always nice to meet you always Spleen to please you

Remember we are keen to know whether your local butcher sells Spleen.
@sam_parham @robinthemint @SarahForshaw1 @John_Cooper_QC @JoanneCecil @TheCriminalBar Just send some more tweets wait for the inevitable
@sam_parham @robinthemint @SarahForshaw1 @John_Cooper_QC @JoanneCecil @TheCriminalBar We are doomed
