Totally un-Australian @Karl6pr @6PRSportsToday if we have to pay for our sports on TV! I'm suffering with the lack of @Iccwordcup15 free TV
#Perth traffic in the afternoons I have no love for you!!!! Ahhhh way to many traffic lights on red and way to many cars!
It seems strange the lack of free to air coverage of the @Iccwordcup15 TV right fail for Australian #Cricket viewing host nation!
